<div class="first"><p> According to this test, which, in my opinion, I find accurate according to my life experiences so far, I am a visual learner, in the sense that I always try to visualise something I am either trying to learn or remember. These test results are also giving some basic hints to try other learning styles, but essentially, I’ll remember the visuals of a topic before I remember their name/role. If I try to spell something out, I’ll picture it in my head and then spell it out, rather than write it down. However, a visual learner if a solitude learner, as, since they won’t visualise what they’re learning by writing it down, they’d have to manually explain what their process is in learning the topic at hand, which slows down sharing ideas and thoughts in a team building exercise.</p></div>

<div class="first"><p> As a hobby, I play Role-play game servers on a Video game called Garry’s Mod. On one of these servers, I am a Moderator/Administrator, and, essentially, that fits the bill of Mediator pretty well. However, the definition of Mediator as a noun and as a personality type are quite different but can fit hand in hand. Seeing as a Mediator always tries to diffuse conflicts before they get out of hand, they’d be a great level-headed figure in any team/group, able to allow conflicts like arguments to happen, but diffuse it if it turns hostile. However, mediator, as a personality type, I typically don’t run into it being used like this often. As a personality type, mediators are quiet, shy individuals with expansive personalities, imaginations and capable of immense empathy. A mediator as a personality type, and as noun can help solidify a team, as they can bring a team close together, with a caring, understanding personality, as well as keeping it together, should topics turn hot.

This typically allows any group that this sort of individual works with to remain efficient, both in the sense that group morale is high, while group productivity is high. I am also moderately agreeable, which fits into the bill of being a Mediator, allowing me to avoid conflict, and help others avoid it too, but standing up for my beliefs.
